At **Ohar**, we value your privacy. Our philosophy is simple: the app is designed to help you meditate without distractions... and that includes not collecting your personal data.

## 🔒 Data We Collect

**None.**

Ohar does not collect, store, or transmit any personal information. We do not require account creation, we do not use analytics, and we never share anything with third parties. All functionality happens locally on your device.

## 🧘‍♂️ Device Permissions

Ohar may optionally request access to:

- **Notifications:** to alert you when a session ends (optional).
- **Audio:** if future versions include a bell sound (also optional).

These permissions are used solely to improve your experience and are never used to track you.

## 📊 Analytics

We do not use Google Analytics, Firebase, or any other tracking tools.  
We don’t even know how many times you’ve meditated.  
You are in control.

## 💬 Contact

If you have any questions about this privacy policy or just want to say hi, you can reach us at:

Thank you for using Ohar. We hope you find calm, focus, and a few good minutes of silence.
